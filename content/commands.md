# Garden Retakes — Command Reference

Every command works from chat with `!` or `/` (e.g. `!guns`) and from console as `css_*`
(e.g. `css_guns`). **Levels**: Everyone · Mod · Admin · Owner (Garden admin registry;
`@css/root` counts as Owner). *Keep this file updated whenever commands change —
it feeds the website `/commands` page (ROADMAP Phase W).*

## Spotlight (fun — watch a specific player)

Keeps an eye on configured player(s) (default: **Damien** / vz7y). Warns the CTs
when a watched T pushes a defined zone in the first seconds of the round, plus a
couple of gag effects. Config: `GardenSettings.Spotlight` (targets, alias,
`AlertWindowSeconds`, `AlertAudience`, `AutoReveal`, `AutoNoJump`). Zones are
per-map in `spotlight_zones/<map>.json`.

| Command | Level | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `!spotlight` | any | Show status (targets, alias, window, audience, zones, auto-flags) |
| `!pushzone list` | any | List this map's push zones |
| `!pushzone add <name> [radius]` | Admin | Save a zone at your feet (default radius 300u) |
| `!pushzone del <name>` / `!pushzone clear` | Admin | Remove one / all zones on the map |
| `!reveal [player] [seconds]` | Admin | Glow a player through walls for **everyone** (default target = Damien, default 30s) |
| `!nojump [player]` | Admin | Toggle: the player can't jump for the round (default target = Damien) |

When a watched player enters a zone in the alert window, everyone in the audience
(CTs by default) gets `⚠ Damien is pushing short!` in chat + center-screen, once
per zone per round.
